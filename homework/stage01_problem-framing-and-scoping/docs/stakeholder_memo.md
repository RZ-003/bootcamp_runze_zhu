# Stakeholder Memo — Tesla Position Evaluation

**To:** The PM

**From:** Runze Zhu

**Subject:** Should we increase or decrease our Tesla holdings?

---

We currently hold 100,000 shares of Tesla. The key decision is whether to **increase** this position, **reduce** it, or **unchange**.  

Our approach is to frame this as a **predictive return problem**, and we will evaluate Tesla’s expected return over the next quarter(Sep-Dec).  

**What I will report:**
- Forecast of expected return (negative value means we will lose money)
- Sharp Ratio
- Recommendation thresholds

**Assumptions:**  
- The rest of the PM's position is unchanged.
- We have access to Tesla’s historical stock prices and market index data.
- There is no transaction cost.
- We can transact without liquidity issues. 


This analysis will provide a suggestion for adjusting Tesla ratio in the portfolio.
